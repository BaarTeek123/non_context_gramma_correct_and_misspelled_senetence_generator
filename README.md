# Non-context grammar correct and misspelled senetence generator

Python module that allows to generate sentences using non-context grammar.The main goal of this module is to generate gramarly corrected and incorrected sentences in a control way. 
Module MisspellGenerator is created to randomly add typing errors that base on Damerauâ€“Levenshtein distance error types: 
- transpose;
- deletion;
- replace; 
- insert.
The _misspell_sentence_ function adds typing errors to the provided as an argument string (the amount of the errors is the second argument of this function). 

The function _generate_sentences_ from SentenceGenerator.py is core one to generate sentence - as the arguments it takes: subject,  
correct and incorrect (optionally) verb phrase and the rest of sentences. The project mainly focuses on simple grammatical constructions: 
- Subject - Verb - Object;
- Subject - Verb - Adjective;
- Subject - Verb - Adverb;
- Subject - Verb - Noun.
